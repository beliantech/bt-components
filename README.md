# bt-components

`bt-components` stands for __Belian Tech Web Components__. It represents the UI components that serves [Belian Tech](https://beliantech.com)'s consumer and B2B products.

A few things that are prioritized in this design system are:

1. Function over form.
2. Clean, standard look vs. trendy look
3. Correctness of behavior

Unfortunately, accessibility has not been a priority given the push to make products from scratch. Contributions welcome.
