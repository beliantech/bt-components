# bt-components

`bt-components` stands for __Belian Tech Web Components__. It represents the UI components that serves [Belian Tech](https://beliantech.com)'s consumer and B2B products.

A few things that are prioritized in this design system are:

1. Function over form.
2. Clean, standard look vs. trendy look
3. Correctness of behavior

Unfortunately, accessibility has not been a priority given the push to make products from scratch. Contributions welcome.

### Expectations

`bt-components` is primarily for Belian Tech use. If your use case does not align with ours we will probably not be developing your feature request due to lack of resources. That said, pull requests are highly welcome and will be merged if done well enough.
